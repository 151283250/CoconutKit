/**
 * A view implementing the Ken Burns effect: A slideshow with random zooming and panning effects, as well as cross dissolve
 * transitions between images.
 *
 * You can instantiate a Ken Burns slide show either using a nib or programmatically. It then suffices to set its
 * images property to the array of images which must be displayed. Other properties provide for further
 * customization.
 *
 * You should not change the frame of a slideshow while it is running. This does not behave properly for the moment.
