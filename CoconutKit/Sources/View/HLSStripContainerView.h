/**
 * A view to which strips (rectangles) can be added, either interactively or progammatically. These strips are defined
 * based on a set of equidistant positions whose number can be set at creation time.
 *
 * The following gestures have been implemented:
 *   - double-tap on an empty location to create a new strip. Strips are created with a default size which can
 *     be freely defined. A strip is created even if not enough space is available (but not if no space is available)
 *     at the tap location
 *   - tap on an existing strip to enter edit mode. Handles are displayed. Tap on one, hold and move the handle
 *     in either direction to resize the strip. Tap again on the strip or on an empty space to leave edit mode. You
 *     can even tap on another strip to enter edit mode for it while leaving edit mode for the previous one.
 *
 * You can create a non-interactive strip container by setting the userInteractionEnabled boolean to NO. In this
 * mode, strips can still be added or removed, but only programmatically.
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithFrame:
