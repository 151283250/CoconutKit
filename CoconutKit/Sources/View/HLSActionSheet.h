/**
 * The built-in UIActionSheet is rather inconvenient when action buttons are enabled or not depending on
 * some context. Imagine for example a menu letting you take a picture using the camera, or choose one
 * from your library. If either one is unavailable for some reason, the corresponding option should not
 * be displayed in the menu. In such cases it is rather inconvenient for the delegate to implement the 
 * actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex:, since the index it receives does not always correspond to the
 * same action depending on which actions buttons were actually available.
 *
 * The HLSActionSheet class solves both issues. When creating an action sheet, you add buttons to
 * it, attaching targets and actions as you would for a button. This makes it easy to keep your
 * code well organized.
 * 
 * To create an action sheet menu, you now proceed as follows:
 *   - initialize the object using the init method (the designated intializer inherited from
 *     UIActionSheet cannot be used anymore)
 *   - further customize the action sheet using the properties inherited from UIActionSheet (if
 *     needed). The destructiveButtonIndex and cancelButtonIndex properties have been overridden
 *     and do nothing anymore
 *   - add the buttons in the order you want them displayed on screen, using the add... methods
 * Then display the HLSActionSheet using the show... methods inherited from UIActionSheet.
 *
 * Wherever you use a UIActionSheet, you can replace it with an HLSActionSheet with little effort.
 * HLSActionSheet is not strictly a drop-in replacement for UIActionSheet, but almost. In general,
 * all you have to do is replacing the 
 *     initWithTitle:delegate:cancelButtonTitle:destructiveButtonTitle:otherButtonTitles:
 * call used to initialize a UIActionSheet with a call to init, followed by calls to the three
 * add methods of HLSActionSheet.
 *
 * Remarks:
 *   - You can still have a delegate if you want. It will catch the exact same events as if you had used
 *     a built-in UIActionSheet.
 *   - iPad: If you tap outside the pop-up, the protocol methods
 *        actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex:
 *        actionSheet:willDismissWithButtonIndex:
 *        actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex:
 *     are called, each one receiving -1 as button index. This is the same as for UIActionSheet, but I
 *     found it useful to have it documented somewhere.
 *
 * Designated initializer: init
