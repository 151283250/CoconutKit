/**
 * Method to create a copy of a managed object. The behavior is as follows:
 *   - if the object implements the HLSManagedObjectCopying protocol, a clone is created, otherwise
 *     the object itself is returned. In the context of reference counting, this is actually
 *     equivalent to a shallow copy (since an object is likely to acquire a reference to the returned
 *     object)
 *   - when creating the clone of an object implementing HLSManagedObjectCopying, all attributes and
 *     relationships are copied, except those excluded by implementing the keysToExclude protocol
 *     method. Copy is made as follows:
 *       * a shallow copy is performed for attributes
 *       * a deep copy is performed for relationships corresponding to ownership (= delete behavior set as
 *         cascade) of owned objects implementing the HLSManagedObjectCopying protocol. In all other cases, 
 *         a shallow copy is performed
 * Note that the object which is copied must belong to the model manager context. The copy which is
 * returned also belongs to the same context.
 *
 * The method returns an object iff successful (changes still have to be committed, though). If the 
 * method returns nil, you should rollback your changes as soon as possible to avoid saving changes in an
 * inconsistent state.
