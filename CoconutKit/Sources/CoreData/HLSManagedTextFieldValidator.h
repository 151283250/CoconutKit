/**
 * A UITextField cannot be its own delegate (this leads to infinite recursion when entering edit mode of a text field
 * which is its own delegate). In general, it is probably better to avoid having an object being its own delegate. If
 * we want to trap text field delegate events to do additional validation, we therefore need an additional object
 * as delegate, and having the real text field delegate as its delegate. This is just the purpose of the (private)
 * HLSManagedTextFieldValidator class.
