/**
 * TODO: Document:
 *   - naming scheme
 *   - never need to call [super check...] (unlike validate... methods). Extremely error-prone if forgotten
 *   - only one single method for consistency check during updates / inserts (checkForConsistency:)
 *   - no more inout parameter for value to validate. As said in the Core Data doc, changing the value could lead
 *     to potentially serious memory management issues
 *   - never call validations defined in the model object. Call the validate method provided below (which takes
 *     into account validations defined in the xcdatamodel)
 *   - to be documented: Check methods always receive *pError = nil when called. The implementation must replace it with
 *     an error on validation failure. These methods are never to be called directly. Therefore, no need to check pError
 *     in them, the implementation can directly assign *pError without testing if pError != NULL
 *   - document: Behavior undefined if a valid<fieldName>:error: is implemented manually
 *   - document: The methods in this category are only available if validations have been injected (TODO: In their
 *               implementation, check this!)
 *
 * Also add unit tests for:
 *   - managed object hierarchies
 *   - validation of relationships between managed objects
