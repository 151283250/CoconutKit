 * Abstract class for tasks. Tasks offer a delegate mechanism for tracking their status. To create your own
 * tasks, simply subclass HLSTask and override the -operationClass method to return the class of the operation
 * responsible for processing the task.
 *
 * A task must not be submitted several times simultaneously (this leads to undefined behavior). A task
 * which was fully processed can be submitted again (and with another delegate if needed), but only when it
 * is not running anymore.

 * Designated initializer: -init
