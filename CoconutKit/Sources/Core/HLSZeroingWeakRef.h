/**
 * A weak reference to an object, which gets automatically set to nil when the object it refers to is
 * deallocated. This is a convenient way to eliminate the crashes usually associated with dangling 
 * pointers. Unlike ARC zeroing weak references, though, HLSZeroingWeakRef objects also provide a
 * way to execute custom code before the reference is zeroed. This is especially useful when it makes
 * sense to proactively stop some process whose delegate gets deallocated, for example.
 *
 * HLSZeroingWeakRef instances must be retained by the objects which store them
