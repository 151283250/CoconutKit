/**
 * Thin wrapper around NSURLConnection. It is tempting to implement a whole networking library, but in the end
 * NSURLConnection has all the power you usually need (caching, support for a large number of protocols, synchronous
 * and asynchronous connections, credentials, etc.).
 *
 * Using NSURLConnection has some inconveniences, though:
 *   - data must be handled manually (whether it is saved in-memory or to disk)
 *   - progress has to be calculated manually
 *   - NSURLConnection delegate is retained, which most of the time leads to a waste of resources, or to running 
 *     connections which have to be cancelled manually when the delegate is discarded. This is error-prone and often 
 *     results in connections running longer than they should in the background
 *
 * HLSURLConnection is meant to solve these issues without sacrificing the power of NSURLConnection, as many
 * networking library do (they usually work with NSURL objects and a fixed protocol, most likely HTTP). An
 * HLSURLConnection object is namely initialized with an NSURLRequest object, which means you can customize
 * it as you need, depending on the protocol you use, the caching policy you require, etc.
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithRequest:runLoopMode:
