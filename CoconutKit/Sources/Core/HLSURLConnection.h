/**
 * Thin wrapper around NSURLConnection. It is namely tempting to implement a whole networking library (several
 * already exist), but in the end NSURLConnection has all the power you usually need (caching, support for a 
 * large number of protocols, synchronous and asynchronous connections, credentials, etc.)
 *
 * Using NSURLConnection has some drawbacks, though:
 *   - the data must be handled manually as it is received (whether it is saved in-memory or on disk)
 *   - the progress has to be calculated manually
 *   - an NSURLConnection object retains its delegate. This decision was probably made to avoid nasty
 *     crashes (a connection trying to call a delegate method on a delegate which has been deallocated), 
 *     but if often leads to connections running longer than expected (if not cancelled when appropriate). 
 *     Consider the example of a view controller creating an NSURLConnection of which it is the delegate. 
 *     The connection must usually be cancelled when the view controller gets removed from view (otherwise 
 *     the view controller will survive until the connection terminates, which is often not what you
 *     want). Having to cancel a connection manually in such cases is cumbersome.
 *   - the synchronous method call is not appropriate for large downloads
 *   - you have to carefully retain and release the connection objects
 *
 * HLSURLConnection is meant to solve the above issues without sacrificing the power of NSURLConnection, as many
 * networking library do (they usually work with NSURL objects and a fixed protocol, most likely HTTP, which
 * means you have to get back to the good old NSURLConnection when your protocol differs). An
 * HLSURLConnection object is namely initialized with an NSURLRequest object, which means you can customize
 * it as you need, depending on the protocol you use, the caching policy you require, etc.
 *
 * Here are some features of HLSURLConnection:
 *   - data can be saved in-memory (small files) or on disk (needed for large files which won't fit in memory)
 *   - to minimize the need of having to cancel a connection manually (which you can still do if you want),
 *     connections having a delegate are automatically cancelled when their delegate is deallocated (which makes
 *     sense because the only object which was interested by connection events does not exist anymore)
 *   - a connection does not have to be retained if you do not need to cancel it manually (in which case you still
 *     need to keep a reference to it somewhere). Simply fire and forget. When the connection ends it will
 *     deallocates itself. If its delegate is deallocated first the connection will be cancelled and finally
 *     deallocated
 *   - a connection can be started asynchronously or synchronously. In both cases the same set of delegate methods
 *     will be called, which means you do not have to rewrite your code if you sometimes discover the need to
 *     switch between these modes
 *   - connection objects can carry information around (identity, data) and provide information about their progress
 *
 * HLSURLConnection is not thread-safe. You need to manage a connection from a single thread (on which you also
 * receive the associated delegate events), otherwise the behavior is undefined.
