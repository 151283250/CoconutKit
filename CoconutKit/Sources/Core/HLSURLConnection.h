/**
 * Thin wrapper around NSURLConnection. It is namely tempting to implement a whole networking library (several
 * already exist), but in the end NSURLConnection has all the power you usually need (caching, support for a 
 * large number of protocols, synchronous and asynchronous connections, credentials, etc.)
 *
 * Using NSURLConnection has some drawbacks, though:
 *   - the data must be handled manually as it is received (whether it is saved in-memory or on disk)
 *   - the progress has to be calculated manually
 *   - an NSURLConnection object retains its delegate. This decision was probably made to avoid nasty
 *     crashes (a connection trying to call a delegate method on a delegate which has been deallocated), 
 *     but if often leads to connections running longer than expected if not cancelled when appropriate
 *   - the synchronous method call is not appropriate for large downloads
 *   - you have to carefully retain and release connection objects
 *   - the network activity indicator must be managed manually
 *   - HTTP connections: HTTP responses with status codes >= 400 are not treated as failures and must be
 *     handled specifically
 *
 * HLSURLConnection is meant to solve the above issues without sacrificing the power of NSURLConnection, as many
 * networking library do (they usually work with NSURL objects and a fixed protocol, most likely HTTP, which
 * means you have to get back to the good old NSURLConnection when your protocol differs). An HLSURLConnection 
 * object is namely initialized with an NSURLRequest object, which means you can customize it as you need, 
 * depending on the protocol you use, the caching policy you require, etc.
 *
 * Here are some features of HLSURLConnection:
 *   - data can be saved in-memory (small files) or on disk (needed for large files which won't fit in memory)
 *   - to minimize the need of having to cancel a connection manually, connections having a delegate are automatically 
 *     cancelled when their delegate is deallocated (which makes sense because the only object which was interested by 
 *     connection events does not exist anymore). This does not remove the need to cancel connections manually
 *     in some cases, though (e.g. when the delegate is a view controller which disappears without being deallocated 
 *     right afterwards)
 *   - you do not need to keep a reference to a connection if you do not need to cancel it manually. Simply create 
 *     an autoreleased HLSURLConnection object and call an asynchronous start method on it right aftwerwards. The 
 *     connection object will survive during the time it is active. When the connection ends the connection
 *     object will be deallocated automatically. If a delegate has been attached to the connection, and if this 
 *     delegate gets deallocated before the connection ends, the connection will be cancelled, which also leads to
 *     correct deallocation
 *   - a connection can be started asynchronously or (quasi-)synchronously. In both cases the same set of delegate 
 *     methods will be called, which means you do not have to rewrite your code if you sometimes discover the need to
 *     switch between these synchronous and asynchronous behaviors. This is also why the synchronous mode is only 
 *     quasi-synchronous in reality: The call to the start method blocks, but the thread is not blocked as it continues 
 *     to process connection delegate events
 *   - connection objects can carry information around (identity, custom data) and provide information about their 
 *     progress
 *   - the network activity indicator is managed automatically
 *   - HTTP responses with status codes >= 400 are treated as failures by default. A boolean value allows the original
 *     NSURLConnection to be used instead (e.g. if one really needs to access the HTTP body)
 *
 * HLSURLConnection is not thread-safe. You need to manage a connection from a single thread (on which you also
 * receive the associated delegate events), otherwise the behavior is undefined.
