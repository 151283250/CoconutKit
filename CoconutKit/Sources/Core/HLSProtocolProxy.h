/**
 * HLSProtocolProxy allows the easy creation of lightweight proxy objects through which interaction with the 
 * underlying object only happens through a restricted subset of its class interface. The common restricted 
 * interface subset is determined by moving its methods to a protocol which the class must implement.
 *
 * Without HLSProtocolProxy, you can still use a protocol to factor out a restricted interface from an object, have 
 * this object implement this protocol, and return the object as id<protocol> where you want clients to act on it 
 * using the restricted interface. The drawback is that nothing prevents clients from accidentally or purposely 
 * casting the object into its original class (in which case they will still be able to use the full object interface).
 *
 * HLSProtocolProxy allows you to create an indirection level which makes it impossible to accidentally cast
 * the object so that its full interface can be accessed.
 *
 * The proxy object does not retain the object it is created from. If the object gets deallocated, all associated
 * proxy objects are automatically set to nil.
 *
 * TODO: the target could be a proxy as well (refinement)
