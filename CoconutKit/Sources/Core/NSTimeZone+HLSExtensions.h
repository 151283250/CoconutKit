/**
 * Adds some number of seconds to a date, taking daylight saving time issues into account. If a DST transition is crossed,
 * a correction is applied so that the date we get is the one we would have expected. This is in striking contrast with
 * -[NSDate dateByAddingTimeInterval:] which simply works with date objects (i.e. abstract points in time) without time zone
 * consideration issues
 *
 * Example:
 * In 2012, the CET -> CEST transition occurs at 2012-03-25 03:00:00 (CEST, UTC+2) for the Europe/Zurich time zone. If you
 * add a time interval corresponding to 1 day (86400 seconds) to 2012-03-24 06:00:00 (CET, UTC+1), you now have two
 * options:
 *   - if you use -[NSDate dateByAddingTimeInterval:], an hour is lost during the transition, and you obtain
 *     2012-03-25 07:00:00 (CEST, UTC+2)
 *   - if you use dateByAddingTimeInterval:toDate:, a one-hour correction is applied to "negate" the transition.
 *     In the end you obtain 2012-03-25 06:00:00 (CEST, UTC+2)
