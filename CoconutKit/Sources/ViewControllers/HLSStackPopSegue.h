/**
 * Segue class for popping view controllers out of an HLSStackController when using storyboards. The source 
 * view controller can implement the -prepareForSegue:sender: method to further customize transition
 * properties
 *
 * The destination view controller is not used. Simply bind the segue from the view controller to
 * pop to another one (connecting it to the view controller below in the stack is a good idea 
 * since it makes sense graphically, but this is not needed; you can e.g. bind the segue from the 
 * view controller to itself if you want)
