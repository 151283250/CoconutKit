/**
 * Segue class for popping view controllers out of an HLSStackController when using storyboards. 
 *
 * The destination view controller is not used. Simply bind the segue from the view controller to
 * pop to another one (connecting it to the view controller below is a good idea since it makes
 * sense graphically, but this is not needed; you can e.g. bind the segue from the view controller
 * to itself if you want)
