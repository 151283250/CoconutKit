 *   - which view controllers decide whether rotation can occur or not
 *   - which view controllers receive rotation events (for children, this always occur from the topmost to the bottommost
 *     view controller, if they are involved)
 *
 * The default values are currently:
 *   - for iOS 4 and 5: HLSAutorotationModeContainerAndVisibleChildren
 *   - for iOS 6: HLSAutorotationModeContainer

/**
 * Starting with iOS 6, new methods must be implemented to define the set of orientations supported by a view 
 * controller:
 *   -shouldAutorotate
 *   -supportedInterfaceOrientations
 *
 * To avoid having to redundantly implement the old -shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: if your application 
 * must target both iOS 4 / 5 and 6, CoconutKit lets you implement the new iOS 6 methods also on iOS 4 and 5,
 * even if they are officially not available for these versions.
 *
 * In general, if you use CoconutKit in your application, you should / must therefore never have to implement the
 * old -shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method anymore. Implement the new iOS 6 rotation methods only, and 
 * your application will readily be compatible with iOS 4 to 6. You can still implement the old method if you want,
 * but this would be a waste of time and energy.
 *
 * There is only an exception to this rule: If you are using a view controller which you do not control the 
 * implementation of (e.g. a view controller made available by a static library), and whose implementation has
 * been made compatible with iOS 4, 5 and 6 (i.e. which implements all three rotation methods internally), 
 * you should disable the above mechanism by setting the value of the compatibleWithNewAutorotationMethods property
 * to NO for this view controller. Since this should be quite rare, the backwards iOS 6 optional compatibility 
 * mechanism is enabled by default.
 *
 * As a quick reference, when using CoconutKit, keep in mind that:
 *    -shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: is called on iOS 4 and 5 by UIKit, never by UIKit on iOS 6. It can
 *     still be called by client code on iOS 6, of course, though this does not really make sense. The CoconutKit
 *     implementation of -shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: in turns calls the -shouldAutorotate and 
 *     -supportedInterfaceOrientations if both are available
 *    -shouldAutorotate and -supportedInterfaceOrientations are never called by UIKit directly on iOS 4 and 5 (they
 *     are called by CoconutKit, and maybe by client code), and are only available if explicitly implemented by
 *     a view controller. Both are always called starting with iOS 6
 *
 * The following category just declares the iOS 6 rotation methods so that CoconutKit can be compiled against
 * the iOS 5 SDK without warnings.
