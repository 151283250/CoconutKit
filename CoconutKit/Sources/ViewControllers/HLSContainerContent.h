/**
 * View controllers inserted into view controller containers exhibit common properties:
 *   - they belong to a container, which they must be able to identify, and they should not be inserted into several
 *     containers at the same time
 *   - they are removed with the same transition style with which they were inserted into a container
 *   - their view frame is adjusted to match the container view they are added to
 *   - a view controller's view should be created lazily at the time it is really required
 *   - it must be possible to preload a view controller container before it gets actually displayed
 *   - a view controller container must retain the view controllers it manages
 *   - a view controller's view properties should be restored when it is removed from a container. It might namely
 *     happen that a client caches this view controller for later reuse
 *   - view lifecycle events must be forwarded correctly from the container to the contained view controllers
 *   - we sometimes may want the view controller container to forward some properties of a contained view controller
 *     (e.g. title, navigation elements, toolbar, etc.) transparently
 *   - a view controller added to a a container should be able to present or dismiss another view controller modally
 *     by calling the corresponding UIViewController methods on self. In such cases, it is actually the container
 *     which must present the modal view controller. This mechanism must be transparent for the user
 *   - the UIViewController interfaceOrientation property (readonly) is only correctly set when the view controller
 *     is presented using built-in UIKit view controller containers. This has to be fixed when a view controller is
 *     presented using a custom container
 *   - a remark: The UIViewController parentViewController property returns the parent view controller if it is one 
 *     of the buit-in UIKit containers (according to UIViewController documentation). It would make sense to have this
 *     property also return a container for view controllers displayed in custom container view controllers. Sadly
 *     this is not possible: Doing so has some real benefits (automatic forwarding of navigation title and bar color,
 *     correct value for interfaceOrientation), but we lose the ability to choose whether we actually want forwarding
 *     to occur or not. UIKit built-in containers automatically reflect their content, but this must namely not be the 
 *     case for containers in general (imagine a container displaying two view controllers simultaneously: Which one 
 *     is going to give its title to the container controller? The container may also want to have its own title after 
 *     all). For this reason, the parentViewController property should not be altered and returns nil even when a view
 *     controller is embedded into a custom container view controller.
 *
 * The HLSContainerContent class provides a way to ensure that the above common properties can be easily implemented. It 
 * can be seen as some kind of smart pointer object, keeping ownership of a view controller when inserted into a view 
 * controller container. Note that the view controller's view is NOT released when the HLSContainerContent object is
 * destroyed. This lets clients decide whether they want to cache the view (by retaining the associating view controller
 * themeselves) or not (if the view controller is not retained elsewhere, it will simply be deallocated when the 
 * HLSContainerContent object managing it is destroyed, and so will be its view).
 * 
 * HLSContainerContent is a private class. An HLSContainerStack instance is responsible of managing their lifecycle,
 * presenting and dismissing them as required. When implementing a container view controller, the view controller
 * itself is never accessed directly (e.g. when forwarding view controller lifecycle events): Every interaction must
 * happen through an HLSContainerContent to track the view controller status correctly.
 *
 * HLSContainerContent can only be used when implementing containers for which automatic view lifecycle event forwarding
 * has been disabled, i.e. for which the
 *    automaticallyForwardAppearanceAndRotationMethodsToChildViewControllers
 * method returns NO (a feature available as of iOS 5).
 * 
 * Designated initializer: initWithViewController:containerViewController:transitionStyle:duration:
