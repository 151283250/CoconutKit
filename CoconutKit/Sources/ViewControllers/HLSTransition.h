/**
 * Base class for transition animations involving two views (currently for use by containers). To define your
 * own transition animation, subclass HLSTransition and implement the
 *   -layerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inFrame:
 * method to return the HLSLayerAnimationSteps to be played when a view is brought to display, while another one
 * is hidden from view. Only layer animations are supported. You can also optionally implement the
 *   -reverseLayerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inFrame:
 * method (which by default returns nil) to define the animation to be used when performing the reverse transition.
 *
 * When implementing -layerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inFrame:, keep in mind that:
 *   - appearingView and disappearingView must not be used directly (in particular, you must not access their current
 *     frame or alpha). Those view parameters are only provided so that they can be supplied to
 *       -[HLSLayerAnimationStep addLayerAnimation:forView:]
 *     when building the animation steps
 *   - when implementing -layerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inFrame:, create your animation steps
 *     based on the folowing assumptions (regardless of the current appearingView and disappearingView properties,
 *     which you should ignore, as said above):
 *       - both the appearing and disappearing views fill the given frame entirely, i.e. they have
 *           bounds = {0.f, 0.f, CGRectGetWidth(frame), CGRectGetHeight(frame)}
 *       - both views have alpha = 1.f
 *       - the appearing view is on top of the disappearing one
 *     If you need your appearing view to start from a different initial state, use a first "setup" animation step
 *     with duration = 0. This way you can make it initially invisible or outside the frame. Conversely, you can
 *     add a final animation step to make the disappearing view invisible at the end of the animation (this might
 *     be required for animations moving the disappearing view outside the frame, so that it stays invisible when
 *     subsequent animations are played)
 *   - the duration of your animation steps is arbitrary. The sum of those durations defines the default duration
 *     of the resulting animation, which can be retrieved by calling the +defaultDuration on a transition class.
 *     The duration of each animation step might be scaled depending on the total duration which is desired when
 *     the animation is actually played (refer to -[HLSAnimation animationWithDuration:] documentation for more
 *     information)
 *
 * For example, here is the implementation of a push from right animation (the usual UINavigationController animation)
 * with an intrinsic duration of 0.4:
 *
 *   + (NSArray *)layerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:(UIView *)appearingView
 *                                    disappearingView:(UIView *)disappearingView
 *                                             inFrame:(CGRect)frame
 *   {
 *       NSMutableArray *animationSteps = [NSMutableArray array];
 *
 *       // Setup step initially bringing the appearing view outside the frame
 *       HLSLayerAnimationStep *animationStep1 = [HLSLayerAnimationStep animationStep];
 *       HLSLayerAnimation *layerAnimation11 = [HLSLayerAnimation animation];
 *       [layerAnimation11 translateByVectorWithX:CGRectGetWidth(frame) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep1 addLayerAnimation:layerAnimation11 forView:appearingView];
 *       animationStep1.duration = 0.;
 *       [animationSteps addObject:animationStep1];
 *
 *       // The push itself, moving both views to the left
 *       HLSLayerAnimationStep *animationStep2 = [HLSLayerAnimationStep animationStep];
 *       HLSLayerAnimation *layerAnimation21 = [HLSLayerAnimation animation];
 *       [layerAnimation21 translateByVectorWithX:-CGRectGetWidth(frame) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep2 addLayerAnimation:layerAnimation21 forView:disappearingView];
 *       HLSLayerAnimation *layerAnimation22 = [HLSLayerAnimation animation];
 *       [layerAnimation22 translateByVectorWithX:-CGRectGetWidth(frame) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep2 addLayerAnimation:layerAnimation22 forView:appearingView];
 *       animationStep2.duration = 0.4;
 *       [animationSteps addObject:animationStep2];
 *
 *       // Make the disappearing view invisible
 *       HLSLayerAnimationStep *animationStep3 = [HLSLayerAnimationStep animationStep];
 *       HLSLayerAnimation *layerAnimation31 = [HLSLayerAnimation animation];
 *       layerAnimation31.opacityVariation = -1.f;
 *       [animationStep3 addLayerAnimation:layerAnimation31 forView:disappearingView];
 *       animationStep3.duration = 0.;
 *       [animationSteps addObject:animationStep3];
 *
 *       return [NSArray arrayWithArray:animationSteps];
 *   }
 *
 * Have a look at the CoconutKit source code for more examples (HLSTransition.m). Several built-in transition classes are
 * provided by CoconutKit and should fulfill most of your needs.
