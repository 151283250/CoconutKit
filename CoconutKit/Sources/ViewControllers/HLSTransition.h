/**
 * Common class for transition animations involving two views (currently for use by containers). To define your
 * own transition animations, subclass HLSTransition and implement the 
 *   -animationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inFrame:
 * method to return the HLSAnimationSteps to be played when a view is brought to display, while another one is hidden
 * from view.
 *
 * Implement your animations based on the following assumptions:
 *   - appearingView and disappearingView initially fill the given frame entirely (i.e. they have
 *     bounds = (0.f, 0.f, CGRectGetWidth(frame), CGRectGetHeight(frame)). This means that if you want the
 *     appearingView to start outside the frame you will need to use a first "setup" animation step bringing
 *     it into its initial position with a duration of 0
 *   - appearingView and disappearingView both have alpha = 1
 *   - appearingView is on top of disappearingView and both have the same superview
 *   - the duration of your steps is arbitrary. The sum of those durations defines the default duration of the 
 *     resulting animation. This might be scaled depending on the duration which is desired when the animation 
 *     is actually played (refer to -[HLSAnimation animationWithDuration:] documentation
 *
 * For example, here is the implementation of a push from right animation (the usual UINavigationController 
 * animation) with an intrinsic duration of 0.4:
 *
 *   + (NSArray *)animationStepsWithAppearingView:(UIView *)appearingView
 *                               disappearingView:(UIView *)disappearingView
 *                                        inFrame:(CGRect)frame
 *   {
 *       NSMutableArray *animationSteps = [NSMutableArray array];
 *
 *       // Setup step bringing the appearingView outside the frame
 *       HLSAnimationStep *animationStep1 = [HLSAnimationStep animationStep];
 *       HLSViewAnimationStep *viewAnimationStep11 = [HLSViewAnimationStep viewAnimationStep];
 *       [viewAnimationStep11 translateByVectorWithX:CGRectGetWidth(frame) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep1 addViewAnimationStep:viewAnimationStep11 forView:appearingView];
 *       animationStep1.duration = 0.;
 *       [animationSteps addObject:animationStep1];
 *
 *       // The push itself, moving the two views to the left
 *       HLSAnimationStep *animationStep2 = [HLSAnimationStep animationStep];
 *       HLSViewAnimationStep *viewAnimationStep21 = [HLSViewAnimationStep viewAnimationStep];
 *       [viewAnimationStep21 translateByVectorWithX:-CGRectGetWidth(frame) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep2 addViewAnimationStep:viewAnimationStep21 forView:disappearingView];
 *       HLSViewAnimationStep *viewAnimationStep22 = [HLSViewAnimationStep viewAnimationStep];
 *       [viewAnimationStep22 translateByVectorWithX:-CGRectGetWidth(frame) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep2 addViewAnimationStep:viewAnimationStep22 forView:appearingView];
 *       animationStep2.duration = 0.4;
 *       [animationSteps addObject:animationStep2];
 *
 *       return [NSArray arrayWithArray:animationSteps];
 *   }
 *
 * Have a look at the CoconutKit source code for more examples (HLSTransition.m). Several built-in transition
 * classes are defined below
