/**
 * A private class to manage group views in an HLSContainerStackView. Such a view has at most two subviews:
 *   - a mandatory content view displaying the content at a given level within the container stack view
 *     hierarchy. This view is wrapped into a transparent view (frontView) having alpha = 1.f, and which 
 *     must be used for animations. This way animations can safely assume they are animating views with
 *     initial alpha = 1.f, which could not be guaranteed if the content view was directly animated (view 
 *     controller's views can have an arbitrary alpha). This relieves us from extra bookkeeping work
 *   - an optional group view displayed behind it
 * Refer to HLSContainerStackView for more information
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithFrame:frontView:
