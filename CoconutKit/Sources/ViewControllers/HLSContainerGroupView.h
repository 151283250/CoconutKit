/**
 * A private class to manage group views in an HLSContainerStackView. Such a view has at most two subviews,
 * one for the front content (mandatory and which cannot be changed), and another one for the back content 
 * (optional, and which can be changed).
 *
 * Each of those views is wrapped into a transparent wrapper view with alpha = 1.f, which must be used
 * for animations. This way:
 *   - animations can safely assume they animate views with alpha = 1.f. If we had animated the content
 *     views directly, which can have arbitrary alpha values, this would not have been possible
 *   - we can flatten views very easily by replacing the contents within the wrapper with a UIImageView
 *     of their content when appropriate. This can be especially useful to optimize animations, especially
 *     considered the CALayer shouldRasterize setting is only a hint and does not ensure rasterization
 *     will not be made several times during animation
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithFrame:frontView:
