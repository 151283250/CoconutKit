/**
 * The HLSContainerStack class purpose is to make container implementation (which is not a trivial task) as
 * easy as possible. Implementing a view controller container correctly is namely difficult. The
 * HLSContainerStack class offers the following features:
 *   - view lifecycle and rotation events are correctly forwarded to children view controllers
 *   - view controllers can be unloaded or removed when deep enough into the stack (capacity)
 *   - view controller properties (title, navigation items, etc.) can be forwarded automatically to the
 *     container view controller
 *   - view controllers can be added and removed anywhere in the stack with the correct animation
 *   - children view controller views are instantiated when really needed, not earlier
 *   - view controllers can be loaded into a container before it is displayed
 
 * Instead of having to manage children view controllers manually, instantiate a container stack, and attach 
 * it the view where children must be drawn once it is available
 *

/**
 * When a container rotates, its content view frame changes. Some animations (most notably those involving views moved
 * outside the screen, e.g. "push from" animations) depend on the frame size: For a push from left animation, the
 * applied horizontal translation used to move view controllers outside view depends on the interface orientation. 
 * For such animations, we must update the view controller's view positions when the device goes from landscape into 
 * portrait mode, otherwise the views might be incorrectly located after a rotation has occurred. 
 *
 * To perform this change, the following method generates an animation object which must be played when the container
 * your are implementing rotates (if your container is itself a view controller, this means this method must be called 
 * from the willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration: method)
 *
