/**
 * The HLSContainerStack class purpose is to make container implementation (which is not a trivial task) as
 * easy as possible. Implementing a view controller container correctly is namely difficult. The
 * HLSContainerStack class offers the following features:
 *   - view lifecycle and rotation events are correctly forwarded to children view controllers
 *   - view controllers can be unloaded or removed when deep enough into the stack (capacity)
 *   - view controller properties (title, navigation items, etc.) can be forwarded automatically to the
 *     container view controller
 *   - view controllers can be added and removed anywhere in the stack with the correct animation
 *   - children view controller views are instantiated when really needed, not earlier
 *   - view controllers can be loaded into a container before it is displayed
 
 * Instead of having to manage children view controllers manually, instantiate a container stack, and attach 
 * it the view where children must be drawn once it is available
 *

/**
 * When a container rotates, its content view frame changes. Some animations (most notably those involving views moved
 * outside the screen, e.g. "push from" animations) depend on the frame size: For a push from left animation, the
 * applied horizontal translation used to move view controllers outside view depends on the interface orientation. 
 * For such animations, we must update the view controller's view positions when the device goes from landscape into 
 * portrait mode, otherwise the views might be incorrectly located after a rotation has occurred. 
 *
 * To perform this change, the following method generates an animation object which must be played when the container
 * your are implementing rotates (if your container is itself a view controller, this means this method must be called 
 * from the willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration: method)
 *
 * The animation returned by this method has meaningful settings for a rotation animation (locking interaction, resizing 
 * views, bringing views to front). You can still tweak them or set other properties (e.g. delegate, tag, etc.) if needed.

/**
 * Unlike UINavigationController, these events are called when a view controller is shown or hidden, in pair with
 * viewWill and viewDid events sent to the child view controller (these events are of course only received for
 * view controllers at the top of the stack). This makes them more intuitive, meaningful and
 * ultimately useful, though this behavior does not match the one of UINavigationControllerDelegate. It is namely
 * possible to catch appearance and disappearance events both in the child view controllers themselves or in the
 * container delegate, depending on your needs.
 *
 * Moreover, when the willShow method of UINavigationControllerDelegate is called, the child view controller
 * is already installed at the top of [navigationController viewControllers]. This is counter-intuitive and
 * we lose valuable information (i.e. whether the view controller is being added or was already in the child
 * view controller list). This is not the case for HLSContainerStack: The willShow event is sent before a
 * child view controller is shown or even added to the stack. This makes it possible to find whether a push
 * occurs or not.
 *
 * For information, here is UINavigationController behavior: the willShow and didShow methods are called when 
 * presenting a view controller as a result of pushing a new one or popping the one above in the navigation
 * stack. This event is also received when the view controller's view is reloadded after a memory warning has
 * occurred. Similarly for the willHide event (for which UINavigationControllerDelegate has no counterpart),
 * which is received only after the view controller has been hidden or popped off the stack.
