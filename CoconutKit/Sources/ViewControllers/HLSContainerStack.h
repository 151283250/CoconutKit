/**
 * The HLSContainerStack provides a convenient and easy interface to implement your own view controller containers,
 * which is usually not a trivial task. Unlike the UIViewController containment API, this class is compatible with 
 * iOS 4 as well, and provides powerful features which let you implement custom containers correctly in a snap. The 
 * iOS 5containment API, though powerful, namely still requires a lot of work to implement perfect containers. 
 * This is not the case with HLSContainerStack, which provides a robust way to implement the containers of your
 * dreams.
 *
 * A lot of work has been made to provide a clean and powerful interface to implement containers exhibiting
 * correct behavior and maximum flexibility. Most notably:
 *   - view lifecycle and rotation events are correctly forwarded to children view controllers
 *   - custom animations can be provided when pushing view controllers into a stack. A standard set of
 *     animations is provided out of the box. Animations behave correctly in all cases, even if the stack
 *     was rotated between push and pop operations, or if views have been unloaded
 *   - a delegate (usually your container implementation) can register itself with a stack to be notified when 
 *     a view controller gets pushed, popped, appears or disappears. The set of delegate methods which can be 
 *     implemented is far richer than the ones of UIKit built-in containers (most notably UINavigationController). 
 *     Your custom containers usually just need to forward the events their users might be interested in through a
 *     dedicated delegate protocol
 *   - the methods -[UIViewController isMovingTo/FromParentViewController] return correct results, consistent
 *     with those returned when using standard built-in UIKit containers (iOS 5 only)
 *   - a depth can be provided so that children view controller's views deep enough are automatically unloaded
 *     and reloaded when needed, saving memory. Alternatively, a view controller can be removed from the stack
 *     as soon as it gets deep enough. This makes it possible to implement containers with a FIFO behavior (the
 *     case where the depth is set to 1 corresponds to a stack displaying a single child view controller)
 *   - custom containers implemented using HLSContainerStack behave correctly, whether they are embedded into 
 *     another container (even built-in ones), displayed as the root of an application, or modally
 *   - stacks can be used to display any kind of view controllers, even standard UIKit containers like
 *     UITabBarController or UINavigationController
 *   - custom containers can be nested to create any kind of application workflow
 *   - view controllers can be preloaded into a stack before it is actually displayed
 *   - view controllers can be inserted into or removed from a stack at any position. Methods have been supplied
 *     to pop to a given view controller (even the root one) or to remove all view controllers at once
 *   - children view controller's views are instantiated right when needed, avoding wasting memory
 *   - view controllers are owned by a stack, but if you need to cache some of them for performance reasons,
 *     you still can: Simply keep and manage an external strong reference to the view controllers you want to cache
 *   - storyboards are supported (iOS 5 and above only). You are responsible of implementing segues in your own
 *     container implementations, though (see HLSPlaceholderViewController.m and HLSStackController.m for examples)
 *   - view controller containment relationships are consistent with those expected from UIKit built-in containers.
 *     In particular, some properties are automatically forwarded from a child view controller to a navigation
 *     controller if it displays a custom container, and modal view controllers are presented by the furthest
 *     ancestor container
 *   - a custom container can contain several HLSContainerStacks if it needs to display several children view
 *     controllers simultaneously
 *
 * When implementing your own view controller container, be sure to call the following HLSContainerStack
 * methods, otherwise the behavior is undefined (refer to their documentation for more information):
 *   - releaseViews
 *   - viewWillAppear:
 *   - viewDidAppear:
 *   - viewWillDisappear:
 *   - viewDidDisappear:
 *   - shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:
 *   - willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:
 *   - willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration:
 *   - didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:duration:
 * (the deprecated 2-step rotation methods are not supported, you should not have your own containers implement
 * them)
 * Also do not forget to set a containerView, either in your container -loadView or -viewDidLoad methods
 *
 * Remark: No methods have been provided for -viewDidLoad and -viewDidUnload (call -releaseViews instead)
 *
 * Even though the new iOS 5 containment API is promising, implementing your own view controllers using
 * HLSContainerStack has many advantages, and is far easier. For examples of implementations, have a look 
 * at HLSStackController.m and HLSPlaceholderViewController.m. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
