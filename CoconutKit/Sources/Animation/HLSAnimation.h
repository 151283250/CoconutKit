/**
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is a collection of animation steps (HLSAnimationStep), each representing collective changes
 * applied to sets of views or layers during some time interval. An HLSAnimation object simply chains those changes together 
 * to play a complete animation. It also provides a convenient way to generate the corresponding reverse animation.
 *
 * An HLSAnimation can be made of view-based animation steps (HLSViewAnimationStep) or layer-based animation steps
 * (HLSLayerAnimationStep). You can mix both types of animation steps within the same animation, but you must
 * not alter a view both in a view and in a layer animation step, otherwise the behavior is undefined. In general,
 * you should use HLSLayerAnimationSteps, except if you want to animate a view whose contents must resize appropriately
 * (in which case use an HLSViewAnimationStep)
 *
 * Unlike UIView animation blocks, the animation delegate is not retained. This safety measure is not needed since
 * an HLSAnimation is automatically cancelled if it has a delegate and the delegate is deallocated. This eliminates
 * the need to cancel the animation manually when the delegate is destroyed (except, of course, if no delegate has
 * been defined)
 *
 * Animations can be played animated or not (yeah, that sounds weird, but I called it that way :-) ). When played
 * non-animated, an animation reaches its end state instantaneously. This is a perfect way to replay an animation
 * when rebuilding a view which has been unloaded (typically after a view controller received a memory warning 
 * notification).
 *
 * HLSAnimation does not provide any safety measures against non-integral frames (which ultimately lead to blurry
 * views). The reason is that fixing such issues in an automatic way would make reverse animations difficult to
 * generate, since HLSAnimation does not store any information about the original state of the views which are 
 * animated.
 *
 * Delegate methods can be implemented by clients to catch animation events. An animated boolean value is received
 * in each of them, corresponding to how playAnimated: was called. For steps whose duration is 0, the boolean is
 * also YES if the animation was run with animated = YES (even though the step was not animated, it is still
 * part of an animation which was played animated).
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithAnimationSteps:
