/**
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is a collection of animation steps (HLSAnimationStep), each representing collective changes
 * applied to sets of views during some time interval. An HLSAnimation object simply chains those changes together to play 
 * a complete animation. It also provides a convenient way to generate the corresponding reverse animation.
 *
 * Be careful not to have an object dying earlier than the animation it is the delegate of, otherwise your code
 * will crash when the animation tries to notify the dead delegate about its status. You have several options here:
 *   - cancel the animation first
 *   - unregister the delegate, and let the animation run until the end
 *   - lock the UI during the animation (lockingUI animation property). This prevents the user from doing something
 *     which could lead to the delegate destruction (e.g. navigating away if the delegate is a view controller)
 *
 * Animations can be played animated or not (yeah, that sounds weird, but I called it that way :-) ). When played
 * non-animated, an animation reaches its end state instantaneously. This is a perfect way to replay an animation
 * when rebuilding a view which has been unloaded (typically after a memory warning has been received). Animation
 * steps with duration equal to 0 also occur instantaneously.
 *
 * Delegate methods can be implemented by clients to catch animation events. An animated boolean value is received
 * in each of them, corresponding to how playAnimated: was called. For steps whose duration is 0, the boolean is
 * also YES if the animation was run using playAnimated:YES (even though the step was not animated, it is still
 * part of an animation which was played animated).
 *
 * If the resizeViews property is set to YES, an animation alters the frames of the involved views. If this property 
 * is set to NO, the animation only alters the view transforms, which means the views will be applied a zoom level.
 * View resizing is currently quite experimental and is therefore disabled by default.
 *
 * When resizeViews is set to YES, only translation and scale transforms can be applied since the frame is involved.
 * Other transforms will be ignored, and a warning message will be logged in such cases
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithAnimationSteps:
