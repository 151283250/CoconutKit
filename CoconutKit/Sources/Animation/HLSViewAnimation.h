/**
 * A view animation (HLSViewAnimation) describes the changes applied to a view within an animation group 
 * (HLSViewAnimationGroup). An animation group is the combination of several view animations applied 
 * to a set of views, and represent the collective set of changes applied to them during some time interval. 
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation groups, either view-based
 * (HLSViewAnimationGroup) or layer-based (HLSLayerAnimationGroup).
 *
 * A view animation:
 *   - animates view frames. Those views have to correctly respond to such changes, either by setting
 *     their autoresizing mask properly, or by implementing -layoutSubviews if they need more control
 *     over the resizing process
 *   - applies only affine operations
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create a view animation group with default settings)
