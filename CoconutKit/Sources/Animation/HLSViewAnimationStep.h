/**
 * A view animation step describes the changes applied to a view during an animation step (HLSAnimationStep). An 
 * animation step is the combination of several view animation steps (HLSViewAnimationStep) applied to a set of views, and 
 * represent the collective set of changes applied to these views during some time interval. An animation (HLSAnimation) 
 * is then simply a collection of animation steps.
 *
 * Several convenience constructors are available to help you create view animation steps without requiring you to calculate 
 * coordinates explicitly (you can if you require this flexibility, of course). After you have created a view animation step 
 * object, you can use the other available accessors to set more properties.
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create a view animation step with default settings)
