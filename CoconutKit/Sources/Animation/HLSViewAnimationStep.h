/**
 * A view animation step describes the changes applied to a view during an animation step (HLSAnimationStep). An 
 * animation step is the combination of several view and / or layer animation steps (HLSViewAnimationStep,
 * HLSLayerAnimationStep) applied to a set of layers and views, and represent the collective set of changes applied 
 * to thhem during some time interval. An animation (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation steps.
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create a view animation step with default settings)
 * NSCopying behavior: Deep copy
