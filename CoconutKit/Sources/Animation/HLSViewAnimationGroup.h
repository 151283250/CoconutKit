 * A view animation group (HLSViewAnimationGroup) is the combination of several view animations (HLSViewAnimation) applied
 * to a set of views, and represent the collective set of changes applied to them during some time interval. An animation
 * (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation groups, either view-based (HLSViewAnimationGroup) or layer-based 
 * (HLSLayerAnimationGroup).

 * Designated initializer: init (create an animation group with default settings)
