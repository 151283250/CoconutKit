/**
 * A layer animation (HLSLayerAnimation) describes the changes applied to a layer within an animation group
 * (HLSLayerAnimationGroup). An animation group is the combination of several layer animations applied
 * to a set of layerss, and represent the collective set of changes applied to them during some time interval.
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation groups, either view-based
 * (HLSViewAnimationGroup) or layer-based (HLSLayerAnimationGroup).
 *
 * A layer animation animates layer transforms. This choice was made because frame animation would limit
 * transforms to affine transforms, for which HLSViewAnimation can be used (if the layer belongs to a view,
 * of course). Moreover, unlike views, layers do not layout their sublayers automatically based on autoresizing 
 * properties (which are not available in iOS; -[CALayer layoutSublayers] or -[UIView layoutSublayersForLayer]
 * must be implemented in subclasses for such purposes, the latter if the layer belongs to a view)
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create a layer animation group with default settings)
