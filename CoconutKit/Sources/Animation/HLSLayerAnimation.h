/**
 * A layer animation (HLSLayerAnimation) describes the changes applied to a layer within an animation step
 * (HLSLayerAnimationStep). An animation step is the combination of several layer animations applied
 * to a set of layers, and represent the collective set of changes applied to them during some time interval.
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation steps, either view-based
 * (HLSViewAnimationStep) or layer-based (HLSLayerAnimationStep).
 *
 * A layer animation animates layer transforms, not frames. This choice was made because frame animation would 
 * restrict transforms to affine transforms, for which HLSViewAnimation can be used instead (provided the layer 
 * belongs to a view, of course). Moreover, unlike views, layers do not layout their sublayers automatically based 
 * on autoresizing properties in iOS (the -[CALayer layoutSublayers] or -[UIView layoutSublayersOfLayer:] methods
 * have to be implemented to respond to frame changes)
 *
 * Since the layer transform is animated, none of the -[CALayer layoutSublayers] or -[UIView layoutSublayersOfLayer:] 
 * methods need to be implemented for layers which are animated.
 *
 * In general, and if you do not need to animate view frames to resize subviews during animations, you should
 * use layer animations instead of view animations since they have far more capabilities.
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create a layer animation step with default settings)
