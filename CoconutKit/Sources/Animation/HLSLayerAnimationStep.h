/**
 * A layer animation step describes the changes applied to a layer during an animation step (HLSAnimationStep). An
 * animation step is the combination of several layer and / or view animation steps (HLSLayerAnimationStep, 
 * HLSViewAnimationStep) applied to a set of views and layers, and represent the collective set of changes applied 
 * to them during some time interval. An animation (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation steps.
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create a layer animation step with default settings)
 * NSCopying behavior: Deep copy
