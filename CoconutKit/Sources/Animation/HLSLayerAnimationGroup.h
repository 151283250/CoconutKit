 * A layer animation group (HLSLayerAnimationGroup) is the combination of several layer animations (HLSLayerAnimation) applied
 * to a set of layers, and represent the collective set of changes applied to them during some time interval. An animation
 * (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation groups, either view-based (HLSViewAnimationGroup) or layer-based
 * (HLSLayerAnimationGroup).
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create an animation group with default settings)
