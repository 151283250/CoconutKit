nut library
-----------
This library is a collection of tools and reusable components used at Hortis le Studio.

To compile and use the library in the way it is intended to be used, download the make-fmwk and link-fmwk.sh commands 
available at:
    https://github.com/defagos/make-fmwk
    
To build the library, run the make-fmwk command from the nut project main directory (the one containing nut.xcodeproj), 
as follows:
    make-fmwk.sh Release                        for the release binaries
    make-fmwk.sh Debug                          for the debug binaries
    make-fmwk.sh -s Debug                       for the debug binaries (with source code for debugging)
This creates three .staticframework files in your ~/StaticFrameworks directory.

To use the library in a project, add a frameworks.txt file in its main directory, containing either
    nut-Release
    nut-Debug
    nut-Debug-src
depending on the .staticframework you intend to use (for production code, you must of course use the Release package).
Then run the link-fmwk.sh command without parameter from the project main directory:
    link-fmwk.sh
This generates a symbolic link to the corresponding .staticframework directory in ~/StaticFrameworks. This symbolic
link, which you will find in the StaticFrameworks subdirectory of your project (generated by link-fmwk), must then
be added to your project. Build and run, you are done.

nut-demo project
----------------
A demo project is provided. To compile it, first build the nut-Release .staticframework (as described above), then 
run the link-fmwk command from the nut-demo project main directory (the one containing nut-demo.xcodeproj). The
project can then be built.
