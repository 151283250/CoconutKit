// TODO: See HLSServiceBoundObject: Objects should not be retained, only weak pointers must be stored by HLSServiceBoundArray.
//       But this requires us to write an array which does not send a retain message to objects put within it first!

/**

// If an "updatedIndexes" NSArray is available from userInfo, then a partial update of the objects located
// at those indexes occurred (the caller can just update those entries). Otherwise a global updated occurred

/**
 * Service arrays are arrays of objects kept in sync with the cache of objects managed by a web service broker.
 * These arrays can be bound to a specific request, i.e. when the request answer is received the object will
 * automatically be updated and notify its observers. Moreover, cache objects updated because of another query
 * will also trigger a notification. In both cases observers will receive a HLSServiceBoundArrayUpdatedNotification.
 *
 * Sort descriptors can also optionally be associated with this array, otherwise the objects will be stored
 * as the web service returns them.
 *
 * Since web services always do not provide a way to get requests filtered against some criteria or sorted
 * against other ones, HLSServiceBoundArray provides a way to attach filters and sorters. When the data is
 * received, objects are filtered and sorted before being stored.
