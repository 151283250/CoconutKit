// TODO: Use strip identifiers? Returning them when strips are added / removed. This would then offer an opaque handle
//       to get the strip itself without having to return the rectangular view. Well, maybe that's too much
// Remark: Strips can never overlap, even when they are moved. This way, at most two strips can be merged at any time
