// TODO: Use strip identifiers? Returning them when strips are added / removed. This would then offer an opaque handle
//       to get the strip itself without having to return the rectangular view. Well, maybe that's too much
// Remark: Strips must never overlap, even when they are moved (and their distance must be at least 1 unit if they
//         have the same type, otherwise merge will occur). At most two strips can be merged at any time
