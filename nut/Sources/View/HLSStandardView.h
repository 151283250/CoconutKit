 * of the corresponding class), instead of putting redundant code in all code using the view.
 *
 * Use the factory method for creating a view in a standard way as well. The view object must be the first in your 
 * nib file, which must bear the same name as your view class.
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithFrame: (you usually do not need to create a view manually. Use the factory method
