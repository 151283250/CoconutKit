/**
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is a collection of animation steps (HLSAnimationStep), each representing collective changes
 * applied to sets of views during some time interval. An HLSAnimation object simply chains those changes together to play 
 * a complete animation. It also provides a convenient way to generate the corresponding reverse animation.
 *
 * Currently, there is sadly no way to stop an animation once it has begun. You must therefore be especially careful
 * if a delegate registered for an animation dies before the animation ends (do not forget to unregister it before).
 * Moreover, an animation does not retain the view it animates (see HLSViewAnimationStep documentation). You should
 * therefore ensure that an animation has ended before its views are destroyed. The easiest solution to both problems
 * is to lock the UI during the animation (lockingUI animation property). This prevents the user from doing anything
 * nasty (like navigating away).
 *
 * Animations can be played animated or not (yeah, that sounds weird, but I called it that way :-) ). When played
 * non-animated, an animation reaches its end state instantaneously. This is a perfect way to replay an animation
 * when rebuilding a view which has been unloaded (typically after a memory warning has been received). Animation
 * steps with duration equal to 0 also occur instantaneously.
 *
 * Delegate methods can be implemented by clients to catch animation events. An animated boolean value is received
 * in each of them, corresponding to how playAnimated: was called. For steps whose duration is 0, the boolean is
 * also YES if the animation was run using playAnimated:YES (even though the step was not animated, it is still
 * part of an animation which was played animated).
 *
 * An HLSAnimation applies transforms to views. It does not alter the frame, which means view inside it won't resize
 * (according to their autoresizing mask) but rather scale. If scaling is not what you want, you cannot use HLSAnimation
 * objects to manage your animation. In such cases, stick with usual UIView animation blocks for the moment.
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithAnimationSteps:
