/**
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is a collection of animation steps (HLSAnimationStep), each representing collective changes
 * applied to sets of views during some time interval. An HLSAnimation object simply chains those changes together to play 
 * a complete animation. It also provide a convenient way to generate the corresponding reverse animation.
 *
 * Currently, there is sadly no way to stop an animation once it has begun. You must therefore be especially careful
 * if a delegate registered for an animation dies before the animation ends (do not forget to unregister it before).
 * Moreover, an animation does not retain the view it animates (see HLSViewAnimationStep documentation). You should
 * therefore ensure that an animation has ended before its views are destroyed.
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithAnimationSteps:
