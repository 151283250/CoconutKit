/**
 * When creating an animation step (HLSAnimationStep), you need to know which views you are animating. This is perfectly 
 * fine as long as you can get your hands on the views to animate. Some objects might want to hide the internal details 
 * of their views, though, but still want to let you customize the animations they apply on them. In such cases,
 * instantiating animation steps directly is not an option.
 *
 * An HLSOneViewAnimationStepDefinition is a way to provide the components of an animation step involving at most one 
 * unknown view. Conceptually, it is similar to a functor with one argument. This functor can then be applied to generate
 * an animation step once the view is known.
 *
 * The usual example is a view controller container which manages the view controller's views it displays, but which
 * lets you customize the transition animations it uses to present them. By not requiring you to access a view
 * controller's view directly (which would lazily create it), the container can defer instantiation until it really
 * needs to instantiate it.
 *
 * Designated initializer: init
