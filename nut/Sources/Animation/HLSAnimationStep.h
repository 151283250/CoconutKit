/**
 * An animation is made of animation steps, moving a view within its superview from a position into another one (and maybe animating 
 * other animatable properties as well during this process). An animation object simply applies animation steps onto the view
 * it animates. Each step is applied to the state of the animation as yielded by the previous animation step.
 *
 * Several convenience constructors are available to help you create animation steps without requiring you to calculate coordinates
 * explicitly (you can if you require this flexibility, of course). After you have created a step object, you can use the other accessors
 * to set other animatable properties or animation settings.
 *
 * Remark: This class was initially named HLSAnimationFrame, but was renamed to avoid confusion with the UIView frame property
 *         (which is the view property an animation step usually alters!)
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create an animation step with default settings)
