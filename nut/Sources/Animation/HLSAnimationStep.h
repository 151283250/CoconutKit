/**
 * An animation step (HLSAnimationStep) is the combination of several view animation steps (HLSViewAnimationStep) applied
 * to a set of views, and represent the collective set of changes applied to these views during some time interval. An 
 * animation (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation steps.
 *
 * Several convenience constructors are available to help you create animation steps for common cases, most notably
 * when a single view is involved (in such cases, you do no really want to instantiate view animation step objects
 * individually, do you?)
 *
 * Remark: This class was initially named HLSAnimationFrame, but was renamed to avoid confusion with the UIView frame property
 *         (which is the view property an animation step usually alters!)
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create an animation step with default settings)
