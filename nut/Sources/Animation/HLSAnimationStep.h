/**
 * An animation is made of animation steps, moving a view from a position into another one (and maybe animating other animatable 
 * properties as well). The view itself is not part of the HLSAnimationStep object but is managed by the animation, which 
 * successively applies its steps onto it. Each one is applied to the state of the animation as yielded by the previous animation step.
 *
 * Several convenience constructors are available to help you create animation steps without requiring you to calculate coordinates
 * explicitly (you can if you require this flexibility, of course). After you have created a step object, use the other accessors
 * to set other animatable properties or animation settings.
 *
 * Remark: This class was initially named HLSAnimationFrame, but was renamed to avoid confusion with the UIView frame property
 *         which an animation step usually alters
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (identity frame)
