/**
 * TODO: Better documentation
 * About view lifecycle events: When a view controller gets covered by pushing another one, it will receive the viewWill
 * and viewDidDisappear events, even if it stays visible because the newly pushed view controller is transparent. Dealing
 * with transparency would have been way too difficult (you have to consider all superimposed views to know if some
 * view controller's view down the stack is partially visible), and in general we want the covered view controller
 * to behave as if it disappeared (though it still stays visible).
 * Not meant to be subclassed
 *
 * Question: Not meant to be subclassed => which size? Probably largest size available by default and rely on the parent 
 *           view controller's behavior (should be able to automatically resize its child view controller's views properly).
 *           This is the case for UINavigationController, UITabBarController, HLSPlaceholderViewController
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithRootCiewController:
