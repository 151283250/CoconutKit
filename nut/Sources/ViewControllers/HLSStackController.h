 * TODO: Better documentation
 * About view lifecycle events: When a view controller gets covered by pushing another one, it will receive the viewWill
 * and viewDidDisappear events, even if it stays visible because the newly pushed view controller is transparent. Dealing
 * with transparency would have been way too difficult (you have to consider all superimposed views to know if some
 * view controller's view down the stack is partially visible), and in general we want the covered view controller
 * to behave as if it disappeared (though it still stays visible).
