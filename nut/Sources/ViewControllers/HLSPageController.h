/**
 * Remark: The interface is similar to the one of UITabBarController. But since the number of pages can often be quite large 
 * (which is rarely the case with a tab bar controller), this class makes optionally use of the HLSContainerControllerLoader 
 * protocol:
 *   - if the number of view controllers to display is small and they can be created fast, then simply set the
 *     view controllers to display directly using setViewControllers
 *   - if the number of view controlllers to display is large and / or they are slow to create, then create a
 *     view controller loader by implementing the HLSContainerControllerLoader protocol and setting it as loader
 * The behavior is undefined if you attempt to do both.
 *
 * Designated initializer: init:
