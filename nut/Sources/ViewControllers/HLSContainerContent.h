 * view controller's views).
 * The created animation is cached. If the container view changes, you usually will need to call this
 * method again so that the new container view frame dimensions are taken into account.
 * The animation returned by this method has default properties. You usually want to set some of them
 * (e.g. delegate, tag, etc.) right away.

 * There is no accessor for the cached animation, and on purpose. The reason is that the animation must 
 * be created at the very last moment, when we are sure that the frame dimensions of the involved views are
 * known. Having no access to the cached animation enforces this good practice by forcing the user to
 * create the animation when she needs it.
