/**
 * View controllers inserted into view controller containers exhibit common properties:
 *   - they belong to a container, which they must be able to identify, and they should not be inserted into several
 *     containers at the same time
 *   - they are displayed using some transition style, and might be stretched to fill the view when the container
 *     displayed them
 *   - a view controller's view must be created lazily at the time it is really required
 *   - it must be possible to pre-load a view controller container before it gets actually displayed
 *   - a view controller container must retain the view controllers it manages
 *   - a view controller's view properties should be restored when it is removed from a container. It might namely
 *     happen that a client caches this view controller for later reuse
 *   - in general, we want to restrict user interaction to the most recently view controller inserted into a container
 *   - we sometimes may want the view controller container to forward some properties of a contained view controller
 *     (e.g. title, navigation elements, toolbar, etc.) transparently
 * The HLSContainerContent class provides a way to ensure that those common properties can be fulfilled. It can be seen
 * as some kind of smart pointer object, taking ownership of a view controller inserted into a view controller
 * container.
 * 
 * When implementing a view controller container, use HLSContainerContent objects (retained by the container) to take 
 * ownership of a view controller when it is inserted, and simply release the HLSContainerContent object when the view 
 * controller gets removed from the container. When interacting with the view controller, use the HLSContainerContent
 * object as a proxy to help you guarantee that the common properties listed above are fulfulled.
 *

 * Create and cache an animation which displays the view controller using the defined transition style and duration. 
 * You can provide an array of other container contents (i.e. view controllers) to be hidden during the animation.
 * The commonFrame parameter is the frame where all animation take place (usually the view in which the container draws 
 * the view controllers it manages).
 *
 * The created animation is cached internally. This is required if you need to play the reverse animation when removing
 * the view controller from the container (reverseAnimation method). If the container view changes, the cached animation 
 * will most probably not be correct anymore. In such cases, you need to call this method again so that the animation
 * can be updated appropriately (e.g. during a rotation of the interface).
 *
 * The animation returned by this method has default properties. You usually want to tweak some of them (e.g. delegate, 
 * tag, etc.) right after creation.
 *
 * Note that there is an accessor for the reverse animation, but not for the cached animation. This was made on purpose.
 * The reason is that the animation must be created at the very last moment, when we are sure that the frame dimensions 
 * of the involved views are known. Having no access to the cached animation enforces this good practice by forcing the 
 * user to create the animation where she needs it.
