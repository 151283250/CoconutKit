/**
 * View controllers inserted into view controller containers exhibit common properties:
 *   - they belong to a container, which they must be able to identify, and they should not be inserted into several
 *     containers at the same time
 *   - they are added and removed using some transition style, and might be stretched to fill the container's view 
 *     where they are displayed
 *   - a view controller's view should be created lazily at the time it is really required
 *   - it must be possible to pre-load a view controller container before it gets actually displayed
 *   - a view controller container must retain the view controllers it manages
 *   - a view controller's view properties should be restored when it is removed from a container. It might namely
 *     happen that a client caches this view controller for later reuse
 *   - in general, we want to restrict user interaction to the most recently view controller inserted into a container
 *   - we sometimes may want the view controller container to forward some properties of a contained view controller
 *     (e.g. title, navigation elements, toolbar, etc.) transparently
 *   - the UIViewController interfaceOrientation property (readonly) is only correctly set when the view controller
 *     is presented using built-in UIKit view controller containers. This has to be fixed when a view controller is
 *     presented using a custom container
 *   - the UIViewController parentViewController property returns the parent view controller if it is one of the
 *     buit-in containers (according to UIViewController documentation). But it makes sense to return a parent 
 *     when a view controller has been displayed by a custom container view controller. This does not match the 
 *     documentation, but as for the interfaceOrientation property, it seems that Apple was assuming that no other
 *     containers could exist besides built-in ones
 * The HLSContainerContent class provides a way to ensure that those common properties can be easily implemented. It 
 * can be seen as some kind of smart pointer object, taking ownership of a view controller when inserted into a view 
 * controller container.
 * 
 * When implementing a view controller container, use HLSContainerContent objects (retained by the container) to take 
 * ownership of a view controller when it is inserted, and simply release the HLSContainerContent object when the view 
 * controller gets removed from the container. When interacting with the view controller, use the HLSContainerContent
 * object as a proxy to help you guarantee that the common properties listed above are fulfilled.
 * 
 * Designated initializer: initWithViewController:containerController:transitionStyle:duration:
