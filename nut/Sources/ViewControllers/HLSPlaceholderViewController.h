/**
 * View controllers which must be able to embed another view controller as subview can inherit from this class
 * to benefit from correct event propagation (e.g. viewDidLoad, rotation events, etc.). Moreover, this class
 * also supports view controller different depending on the orientation (see HLSOrientationCloner protocol).
 * The inherited class must create a placeholder view instance, either using a xib or by implementing the viewDidLoad
 * method.
 * 
 * The reason this class exists is that embedding view controllers by directly adding a view controller's
 * view as subview of another view controller's view does not work correctly out of the box. Most view controller
 * events will be fired up correctly (e.g viewDidLoad or rotation events), but other simply won't (e.g. viewWillAppear:).
 * This means that when adding a view controller's view directly as subview, the viewWillAppear: message has to be sent
 * manually, which is disturbing and awkward (the same has to be done when removing the view).
 *
 * The wrapped view controller can be swapped with another one at any time. Simply update the viewController property. 
 * This makes pages or tabs easy to code.
 *
 * When you derive from HLSPlaceholderViewController, it is especially important not to forget to call the super class
 * view lifecycle methods first if you override any of them, otherwise the behaviour will be undefined. Similarly 
 * for methods related to interface orientation and initialization methods. This means:
 *   - initWithNibName:bundle:
 *   - initWithCoder: (for view controllers instantiated from a xib)
 *   - viewWill...
 *   - viewDid...
 *   - shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: : If the call to the super method returns NO, return NO immediately (this
 *                                               means that the inset cannot rotate).
 *   - willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:
 *   - willAnimate...
 *   - didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:
 * and to animation:
 *   - viewAnimation...
 *
 * As with standard built-in view controllers (e.g. UINavigationController), the inset view controller's view rect is known
 * when viewWillAppear: gets called for it. If you need to insert code requiring to know the final view dimensions or changing
 * the screen layout (e.g. hiding a navigation bar), be sure to insert it in viewWillAppear: or events thereafter (in other
 * words, NOT in viewDidLoad).
 * You should not alter the inset view controller's view frame yourself, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
 *
 * About view reuse: A view controller is retained when set as inset, and released when done. If no other object keeps
 * a strong reference to it, it will get deallocated, and so will its view. This is perfectly fine in general since
 * it contributes to saving resources. But if you need to reuse a view which has already been built (most likely if you
 * you plan to display it later by the same placeholder view controller), you need to have another object retain the view 
 * controller to keep it alive.
 * For example, you might use HLSPlaceholderViewController to switch through N view controllers using toggle buttons. If 
 * those view controllers bear heavy views, you do not want to have them destroyed when you switch view controllers. You want
 * to pay the price once, either by creating all views at the beginning, or more probably by using some lazy creation mechanism.
 * In such cases, be sure to retain all those view controllers elsewhere (most naturally by the same object which
 * instantiated the placeholder view controller). In such cases, though, you must ensure that this object is capable of
 * releasing the views if memory is critically low. If this object is a view controller, this means you must implement
 * didReceiveMemoryWarning so that cached view controller's views can be set to nil when needed.
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithNibName:bundle:
