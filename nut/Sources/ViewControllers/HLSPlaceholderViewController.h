/**
 * View controllers must sometimes embbed another view controller as "subview". In such cases, it is difficult and
 * cumbersome to achieve correct event propagation (e.g. view lifecycle events, rotation events) to the embedded
 * view controller. The placeholder view controller class allows you to achieve such embeddings, without having
 * to worry about event propagation anymore. Simply subclass HLSPlaceholderViewController and define an area
 * where embedded view controllers ("insets") must be drawn, either by binding the placeholder view outlet
 * in your subclass xib, or by instantiating it in the loadView method. Note that this class also supports view 
 * controllers different depending on the orientation (see HLSOrientationCloner protocol). 
 *
 * The reason this class exists is that embedding view controllers by directly adding a view controller's view as 
 * subview of another view controller's view does not work correctly out of the box. Most view controller events will 
 * be fired up correctly (e.g viewDidLoad or rotation events), but other simply won't (e.g. viewWillAppear:). This 
 * means that when adding a view controller's view directly as subview, the viewWillAppear: message has to be sent
 * manually, which can be easily forgotten or done incorrectly (the same has of course to be done when removing the 
 * view).
 *
 * The inset view controller can be swapped with another one at any time. Several built-in transition styles are
 * available when swapping insets, or you can provide your own animation definition. If the transition is animated, 
 * all inset view controller viewWill / viewDid lifecycle methods will receive animated = YES, even if one of the views 
 * is not moved. This is not an error (what matters is whether the transition is animated or not, not if individual 
 * views are).
 *
 * When you derive from HLSPlaceholderViewController, it is especially important not to forget to call the super class
 * view lifecycle, orientation, animation and initialization methods first if you override any of them, otherwise the 
 * behaviour is undefined:
 *   - initWithNibName:bundle:
 *   - initWithCoder: (for view controllers instantiated from a xib)
 *   - viewWill...
 *   - viewDid...
 *   - shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: : If the call to the super method returns NO, return NO immediately (this
 *                                               means that the inset cannot rotate)
 *   - willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:
 *   - willAnimate...
 *   - didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:
 *   - viewAnimation...
 * This view controller uses the smoother 1-step rotation available from iOS3. You cannot use the 2-step rotation
 * in subclasses (it will be ignored, see UIViewController documentation).
 *
 * As with standard built-in view controllers (e.g. UINavigationController), the inset view controller's view rect is known
 * when viewWillAppear: gets called for it, not earlier. If you need to insert code requiring to know the final view dimensions
 * or changing the screen layout (e.g. hiding a navigation bar), be sure to insert it in viewWillAppear: or events thereafter 
 * (in other words, NOT in viewDidLoad). You should not alter the inset view controller's view frame or transform yourself, 
 * otherwise the behavior is undefined.
 *
 * About view reuse: A view controller is retained when set as inset, and released when removed. If no other object keeps
 * a strong reference to it, it will get deallocated, and so will its view. This is perfectly fine in general since
 * it contributes to saving resources. But if you need to reuse a view controller's view instead of creating it from
 * scratch again (most likely if you plan to display it later within the same placeholder view controller), you need 
 * to have another object retain the view controller to keep it alive.
 * For example, you might use HLSPlaceholderViewController to switch through a set of view controllers using a button bar. 
 * If those view controllers bear heavy views, you do not want to have them destroyed when you switch view controllers, since
 * this would make navigating between tabs slow. You want to pay the price once, either by creating all views at the 
 * beginning, or more probably by using some lazy creation mechanism.
 * In such cases, be sure to retain all those view controllers elsewhere (most naturally by the same object which
 * instantiates the placeholder view controller). You must then ensure that this owner object is capable of releasing 
 * the views when memory is critically low. If the owner object is a view controller, it suffices to implement its 
 * viewDidUnload method and, within it, to set the view property of all cached view controllers to nil. Of course,
 * after having set a view to nil, you should forward its view controller the viewDidUnload message as well. If several
 * views are cached but only a subset (probably one) displayed at once, you also need to implement the didReceiveMemoryWarning
 * method to set invisible cached views to nil and send their view controller the viewDidUnload message.
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithNibName:bundle:
