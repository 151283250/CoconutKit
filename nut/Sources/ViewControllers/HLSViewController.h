 * code of a view controller into two blocks:
 *   - in releaseViews: Release all views retained by the view controller. If your view controller subclass retains view controllers
 *     to avoid creating their views too often ("view caching"), also set the views of thesee view controllers to nil in this method
 *   - in dealloc: Release all other resources owned by the view controller (model objects, other view controllers, etc.)
 * If you are subclassing a class already subclassing HLSViewController, do not forget to send the releaseView message to super first.
